## Abstract

This project explores the prevalence and evolution of social biases in Hollywood films by analyzing dialogues from the 1900s and 2000s using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The research focuses on identifying biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, occupation, and LGBTQ identities, providing insights into Hollywood’s influence on societal norms.

### Key Highlights  
- **Purpose**: Explore how social biases are portrayed in movie dialogues and their evolution across two centuries.  
- **Methodology**: Analyzed 34 films using techniques like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and contextual analysis.  
- **Findings**: Persistent biases were observed in gender and racial portrayals, with notable increases in gender bias in the 21st century.  
- **Significance**: Demonstrates the value of computational methods in identifying biases and informs discussions on media diversity and societal perceptions.

## Introduction

Hollywood films play a pivotal role in shaping societal norms and perceptions. Despite progress in inclusivity, biases remain embedded in cinematic narratives. These biases subtly reinforce social inequalities and influence public attitudes. This project examines these biases by analyzing dialogues from films spanning two centuries, using NLP tools to uncover explicit and implicit stereotypes.

## Data Analysis

- **Dataset**: 34 Hollywood films spanning the 1900s and 2000s.  
- **Annotations**: Dialogues annotated at the Dialogue Turn (DT) level for biases related to gender, race, religion, age, occupation, LGBTQ identities, and more.  
- **Methodology**: Considered speaker identity and context to detect both explicit and implicit biases accurately.

## Methods

### NLP Techniques Used
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Identified emotional tones and sentiments in dialogues using Hate-speech-CNERG.  
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracted key elements such as names, organizations, and locations linked to social identities.  
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Leveraged BERT models to understand nuanced contexts and detect implicit biases.

## Results

### Comparative Bias Counts by Century
- **Gender Bias**: Increased from **1021 instances** in the 1900s to **1623 instances** in the 2000s.  
- **Racial Bias**: Slight decrease from **289 instances** in the 1900s to **273 instances** in the 2000s.  
- **Age Bias**: Significant increase from **203 instances** in the 1900s to **398 instances** in the 2000s.  
- **Occupation and LGBTQ Bias**: Some categories showed an upward trend in the 2000s.  

### Visualizations  
- **Bar Graphs**: Comparative bias counts across centuries.  
- **Heatmaps**: Detailed analysis of bias trends per category and across individual films.

## Conclusion

This project highlights persistent biases in Hollywood cinema and their evolution over time.  
Key insights include:  
- **Increased gender bias** in modern films, despite societal progress.  
- Changes in racial portrayals reflecting broader societal shifts.  
- Hollywood’s significant role in shaping public perceptions and behaviors.  

The study underscores the importance of awareness and proactive efforts to reduce biases in media production. Future work will extend this analysis to other media forms and conduct deeper longitudinal studies.
